  Abstract                 = {Markov logic networks {(MLNs)} combine logic and probability by attaching weights to first-order clauses, and viewing these as templates for features of Markov networks. In this paper we develop an algorithm for learning the structure of {MLNs} from relational databases, combining ideas from inductive logic programming {(ILP)} and feature induction in Markov networks. The algorithm performs a beam or shortest-first search of the space of clauses, guided by a weighted pseudo-likelihood measure. This requires computing the optimal weights for each candidate structure, but we show how this can be done efficiently. The algorithm can be used to learn an {MLN} from scratch, or to refine an existing knowledge base. We have applied it in two real-world domains, and found that it outperforms using off-the-shelf {ILP} systems to learn the {MLN} structure, as well as pure {ILP}, purely probabilistic and purely knowledge-based approaches.},

Progol is implemented in C and available by anonymous ftp. The re-assessment of previous techniques in terms of inverse implication leads to new results for learning from positive data and inverting implication between pairs of clauses.},
