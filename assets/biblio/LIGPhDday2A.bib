  Abstract                 = {An intelligent home is likely in the near future. An important ingredient in an intelligent environment such as a home is prediction – of the next action, the next location, and the next task that an inhabitant is likely to perform. In this paper we describe our approach to solving the problem of predicting inhabitant behavior in a smart home. We model the inhabitant actions as states in a simple Markov model, then improve the model by supplying it with data from discovered high-level inhabitant tasks. For simulated data we achieved good accuracy, whereas on real data we had marginal performance. We also investigate clustering of actions and subsequently predict the next action and the task with hidden Markov models created using the clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of the MavHome (Managing An Intelligent Versatile Home) project is to create a home that acts as an intelligent agent. 1 In this paper, we introduce the MavHome architecture. The role of prediction algorithms within the architecture is discussed, and a meta-predictor is presented which combines the strengths of multiple approaches to in-habitant action prediction. We demonstrate the effective-ness of these algorithms on smart home data.},

  Abstract                 = {The Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Index of ADL) is a scale whose grades reflect profiles of behavioral levels of six sociobiological functions, namely, bathing, dressing, toileting, transfer, continence, and feeding. Its hierarchical nature makes it possible to rank the overall functional status of people in an ordered manner, to make comparisons among them as individuals or groups, and to detect changes over time. Developmental studies have encompassed children as well as adults, the mentally retarded as well as physically disabled, and noninstitutionalized as well as institutionalized people. In view of relationships to behavior of primitive societies and parallelisms between the order of index functions and patterns of child growth and development, the Index of ADL appears to be based on functions of sociobiological primacy. This concept is supported by twenty years of methodological and applied observations. The Index has been used to produce predictive information about chronic conditions and to evaluate the benefits of long-term services. It has been used in profiled measures of severity of illness. As a screening measure and survey measure, it has contributed information about health needs and outcomes which is useful for management, planning, policy making, research, and teaching.},

  Abstract                 = {Many problems require repeated inference on probabilistic graphical models, with different values for evidence variables or other changes. Examples of such problems include utility maximization, MAP inference, online and interactive inference, parameter and structure learning, and dynamic inference. Since small changes to the evidence typically only affect a small region of the network, repeatedly performing inference from scratch can be massively redundant. In this paper, we propose expanding frontier belief propagation (EFBP), an efficient approximate algorithm for probabilistic inference with incremental changes to the evidence (or model). EFBP is an extension of loopy belief propagation (BP) where each run of inference reuses results from the previous ones, instead of starting from scratch with the new evidence; messages are only propagated in regions of the network affected by the changes. We provide theoretical guarantees bounding the difference in beliefs generated by EFBP and standard BP, and apply EFBP to the problem of expected utility maximization in influence diagrams. Experiments on viral marketing and combinatorial auction problems show that EFBP can converge much faster than BP without significantly affecting the quality of the solutions.},
