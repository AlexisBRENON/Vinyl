<!-- Hi.
  This is a example of the use of the Vinyl framework to create an A0 poster.

  You will find some redundant informations if you already read others examples (impressJS or
  revealjs).

  Let's walk through it.

<head>
  <!-- First of all, we load our stylesheet. This one is a basic one, you can of course create new
    ones or only override some of its content. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../assets/css/poster.css"/>
  <!-- HighlightJS coloration theme -->
  <link href="../../assets/libs/highlightjs/styles/github.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<body class="vinyl-a0poster">
  <!-- This is mainly for design.
    Guides will draw lines above your poster, to highlight thirds of your page. The third rules is a
    very basic rule to layout some content, and so this guides allow you to better see where the
    thirds are. Of course they are not displayed when youo print/export the poster.

  <!-- A poster is mainly composed as follow.

    So let's start with the beginning, the header.

  <header>
    <!-- Header is basically composed of the title of the poster and some graphics/logos.
      Use some small tags to style authors, institutes, etc. correctly.

  <!-- The main part is composed of sub-parts. To achieve a good rendering, we will use the section
    tags. Each first level section will be bordered with some shadows and a heavy title.
  -->
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>First level sections</h2>
      <p>This is a classic first level section of the main part of our poster; it is the main blocks
      of your poster. As you can see it, the sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are bordered and shadowed to catch
        the eyes;</li>
        <li>have an heavy title;</li>
        <li>can contain subsections.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>Section and subsections</h2>
      <!-- This `content` block ensure that the content of the section is well padded.
        TODO: Check if it is possible to achieve the same result without this useless div.
      -->
      <div class="content">
        <!-- You can easily define subsections. Just add another `section` tag.
          Define its size compared to its parent. A full width subsection is 12 columns wide. Here,
          we use only the half: `.col-6`.
          The `.separator` class draw a line on the right of the subsection to separate it from its
          neighbours. -->
        <section class="col-6 separator">
          <p>Take a look at this subsection. It is only half the width of the parent section. This
          is one of the key feature of Vinyl, it's grid framework. Look at the bootstrap
          documentation to see all what you can do, it is very powerful. Just to cite a few:
          <!-- It's very common that you have to give some pros and cons. This list is made for you.
            It replace classical bullets by some representative symbols (a + and a -) colored in
            green and red respectivelly.

          <ul class="list-pros-cons">
            <li class="pros">You can nest grids.
            <li class="cons">You cannot easily make grids...</li>

          In fact, you just have to add an `<img>` tag as in the header. But adding some feww
          informations allow autonumbering and caption.
          Enclose an image in a `<figure>` tag to add some bordering. This also allow you to add a
          `<figcaption>` element. Any figure containing a `<figcaption>` element will be
          autonumbered by Vinyl.
        -->

          Scientific/equation notation is a great feature of LaTeX. You can also use it in Vinyl.

      <p>Finally, look below. The bibliography is automatically generated from a bibliography file

      <p>It exists different styles for the bibliography rendering. This one is the default one,
      called&nbsp;<code>plain</code>.</p>
